        <p>
          In February, as the new coronavirus swept across China and shut down
          entire cities, a scientist named Sai Li set out to paint its portrait.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the time, the best pictures anyone had managed to take were
          low-resolution images, in which the virus looked like a barely
          discernible smudge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Li, a structural biologist at Tsinghua University in Beijing,
          joined forces with virologists who were rearing the virus in a
          biosafety lab in the city of Hangzhou. Those researchers doused the
          viruses with chemicals to render them harmless and then sent them to
          Dr. Li.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Li and his colleagues then concentrated the virus-laden fluid from
          a quart down to a single drop. He could only hope that they had done
          everything just right, so that the weeks of work to produce that drop
          would not have been a waste.
        </p>
        <p>
          “At the time, you don’t know what’s inside,” Dr. Li said. “It’s just
          liquid, right?”
        </p>

        <h2>Glimpsing the Structure</h2>
        <p>
          Dr. Li carefully froze the drop in a fraction of a second. If he made
          the slightest mistake, ice crystals could spear the viruses, tearing
          them apart.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hoping for the best, Dr. Li placed the smidgen of ice into a
          cryo-electron microscope. The device fired beams of electrons at the
          sample. As they bounced off the atoms inside, Dr. Li’s computer
          reconstructed what the microscope had seen. When the picture formed,
          he was taken aback.
        </p>
        <p>“I saw a screen full of viruses,” Dr. Li recalled.</p>

        <p>
          He could see thousands of coronaviruses packed in the ice like
          jellybeans in a jar. They were beautifully intact, allowing him to
          inspect details on the viruses that measured less than a millionth of
          an inch.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I thought, I was the first guy in the world to see the virus in such
          good resolution,” Dr. Li recalled.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the following weeks, Dr. Li and his colleagues
          <a
            href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)31159-4?rss=yes"
          >
            pored over the viruses
          </a>
          . They inspected the proteins that studded its surface and they dove
          into its core, where the virus’s strand of genes was coiled up with
          proteins. The pictures reminded Dr. Li of eggs in a nest.

        <p>
          Thanks to the work of scientists like Dr. Li, the new coronavirus,
          known as SARS-CoV-2, is no longer a cipher. They have come to know it
          in intimate, atomic detail. They’ve discovered how it uses some of its
          proteins to slip into cells and how its intimately twisted genes
          commandeer our biochemistry. They’ve observed how some viral proteins
          throw wrenches into our cellular factories, while others build
          nurseries for making new viruses. And some researchers are using
          supercomputers to create complete, virtual viruses that they hope to
          use to understand how the real viruses have spread with such
          devastating ease.
        </p>
        <p>
          “This time is unlike anything any of us has experienced, just in terms
          of the bombardment of data,” said Rommie Amaro, a computational
          biologist at the University of California at San Diego.
        </p>

        <h2>Probing the Spike</h2>
        <p>
          Earlier this year, Dr. Amaro and other researchers directed much of
          their attention to the proteins, called spikes, that stud the virus’s
          surface. Spike proteins have an essential job to play: They latch onto
          cells in our airway so the virus can slip inside. But it soon became
          clear that the name is a misnomer. The spike protein is not sharp,
          narrow or rigid.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each spike protein snaps together with two others, forming a structure
          that has a tulip-like shape. A long stem anchors the proteins to the
          virus, and their top looks like a three-part flower.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gerhard Hummer, a computational biophysicist at the Max Planck
          Institute of Biophysics, and his colleagues used the frozen microscopy
          method to take pictures of spike proteins embedded in the virus
          membrane. Then they calculated how the atoms in the proteins pushed
          and pulled on each other. The result was a molecular dance:
          <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6513/203">
            The spike proteins swivel around on three hinges
          </a>
          .

        <p>
          “You can see these flowers waving with all kinds of bending angles,”
          Dr. Hummer said. “It’s quite surprising to have such a long, slender
          stalk with so much flexibility.”
        </p>

        <h2>A Sugar Shield</h2>
        <p>
          Dr. Hummer speculated that the flexibility of the spike was important
          to the virus’s success. By sweeping around, the spike increases its
          odds of encountering the protein on the surface of our cells it uses
          to attach.
        </p>
        <p>
          As they sweep around, however, the spikes can be attacked by
          antibodies, the powerful soldiers of our immune system. To hide, they
          create
          <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.0c01056">
            a shield out of sugar
          </a>
          . Sugar molecules, in navy below, swirl around the proteins and hide
          them from antibodies.

          A little hook at the end of the spike protein, in light blue below,
          sometimes flips up above the sugar shield. If it encounters a
          particular protein on the surface of our cells, it sets off a series
          of reactions that allows the virus to fuse to a cell membrane and
          inject its genes.

        <h2>Tangled Loops</h2>
        <p>
          The genes of the new coronavirus are arrayed on a molecular strand
          called RNA. On Jan. 10, Chinese researchers published its sequence of
          30,000 letters. That genetic text stores the information required for
          a cell to make the virus’s proteins.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the genome is more than a cookbook. The strand folds into a
          devilishly complex tangle. And that tangle is crucial for the virus’s
          exploitation of our cells. “You have a lot more information stored in
          how it’s shaped,” said Sylvi Rouskin, a structural biologist at the
          Whitehead Institute.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Rouskin led a team of scientists who mapped that shape. In a
          high-security lab at Boston University, her colleagues infected human
          cells with the viruses and gave them time to make thousands of new RNA
          strands. Tagging the genetic letters on the strands with chemicals,
          Dr. Rouskin and her colleagues could determine how the strand folded
          in on itself.
        </p>
        <img

        <span class="caption">

        <p>
          In some places it only formed short side-loops. In other places,
          hundreds of RNA letters ballooned out into big hoops, with loops
          coming off, and more loops coming off of them. By comparing millions
          of viral genomes, Dr. Rouskin and her colleagues discovered places
          where the virus slips from one shape to another.
        </p>
        <p>
          A number of researchers are now closely examining some of these
          regions to figure out what they’re doing. Their studies suggest that
          these knots allow the virus to control our ribosomes, the tiny
          cellular factories that pump out proteins.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the virus enters a human cell, our ribosomes attach to its RNA
          strands and glide down them like a roller coaster car running along a
          track. As the ribosomes pass over the genetic letters, they build
          proteins with corresponding structures. Scientists suspect that the
          loops of RNA may throw the roller coaster car off its track and then
          guide it to a spot thousands of positions away.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other loops force the ribosome to back up a bit and then move forward
          again. This little hiccup can cause the virus to make entirely
          different proteins from the same stretch of RNA.
        </p>

        <h2>Jamming the Machinery</h2>
        <p>
          The viral proteins that spew out of our ribosomes fan out across the
          cell to carry out different tasks. One of them, called Nsp1, helps
          seize control of our molecule machinery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Joseph Puglisi, a structural biologist at Stanford, and his colleagues
          mixed Nsp1 proteins and ribosomes together in test tubes. They found
          that the proteins, in pink below,
          <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.20.259770v1">
            slipped neatly
          </a>
          into the channels inside the ribosomes where RNA would normally fit.
        </p>

        <span class="caption">

        </span>
        <p>
          Dr. Puglisi suspects that Nsp1 stops our cells from making proteins of
          their own — especially the antiviral proteins that could destroy the
          virus. But that raises the question of how the virus gets its own
          proteins made.
        </p>
        <p>
          One possibility is that “somehow the virus is just amped up in its
          ability to produce protein,” Dr. Puglisi said. From time to time, Nsp1
          falls out of ribosomes, and somehow the virus does a better job of
          taking advantage of those brief opportunities. “We hoped it was going
          to be something simple,” he said. “But, as usual in science, it
          wasn’t.”
        </p>

        <h2>Blobs and Droplets</h2>
        <p>
          While Nsp1 is manipulating ribosomes, other viral proteins are busy
          making new viruses. A half-dozen different proteins come together to
          make new copies of the virus’s RNA. But something remarkable happens
          along the way: Together, the proteins and RNA spontaneously turn into
          a droplet, akin to a blob in a lava lamp.
        </p>
        <p>
          Physicists have long known that molecules in a liquid spontaneously
          form droplets if the conditions are right. “This is just making salad
          dressing,” said Amy Gladfelter, a cell biologist at the University of
          North Carolina.

          But only in recent years have biologists discovered that our cells
          regularly make droplets for their own purposes. They can bring
          together certain molecules in high concentrations to carry out special
          reactions, shutting out other molecules that can’t enter the droplets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Richard Young, a biologist at the Whitehead Institute, and his
          colleagues have mixed together SARS-CoV-2 proteins that build new RNA
          along with RNA molecules. When the molecules assemble, they
          spontaneously form droplets. The virus likely gets the same benefits
          as the cell does from this strategy.

          Given the sophistication of the coronavirus in so many other regards,
          Dr. Young wasn’t surprised by his discovery. “Why wouldn’t viruses
          exploit a property of matter?” he said.
        </p>

        <h2>Pores and Tunnels</h2>
        <p>
          Coronaviruses can coax human cells to form new chambers to house their
          genetic material. But when Montserrat Bárcena, a microscopist at the
          Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands, inspected those
          chambers, she was baffled: There seemed to be no holes in the
          membranes, allowing no path for the RNA to get in or out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently, Dr. Bárcena and her colleagues took a closer look and
          discovered a way through. One of the coronavirus’s proteins, called
          Nsp3,
          <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6509/1395">
            folds into a tunnel
          </a>
          , which then plugs itself into the membranes.

          riddle, and now we have an answer.”
        </p>

        <h2>Assembling New Viruses</h2>
        <p>
          In a matter of hours, an infected cell can make thousands of new virus
          genomes. The cell’s ribosomes read their genes, spewing out even more
          viral proteins. Eventually, some of those proteins and the new genomes
          assemble themselves to make new viruses.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is no easy task, because the coronavirus’s strand of genes is a
          hundred times longer than the virus itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recent experiments suggest that, once again, SARS-CoV-2 uses lava-lamp
          physics to its advantage. Proteins called nucleocapsids glue
          themselves to spots along the length of the RNA strand. Together, the
          molecules

          </a>
          into droplets.

          Dr. Gladfelter speculated that this strategy prevented two strands of
          genes from becoming tangled with each other. As a result, each new
          virus winds up with just one set of genes.
        </p>
        <p>
          These droplets are swallowed up inside viral membranes and spike
          proteins, and the new viruses are ready to escape the cell. To
          simulate these viruses down to every atom, Dr. Amaro is gathering the
          emerging pictures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and RNA. She and her
          colleagues then construct virtual viruses on supercomputers, each
          consisting of a half-billion atoms. These machines can then use the
          laws of physics to simulate the dancing of the viruses every
          femtosecond: in other words, a millionth of a billionth of a second.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Amaro and her colleagues hope to use her simulated viruses to
          tackle one of the most contentious questions about Covid-19: how the
          virus spreads from person to person.
        </p>
        <p>
          When infected people exhale, talk or cough, they release tiny drops of
          water laden with viruses. It’s not clear how long SARS-CoV-2 can
          survive in these drops. Dr. Amaro is planning to build these drops,
          down to their individual water molecules, on her computer. Then she’ll
          add viruses and watch what happens to them.

          “I’m pretty confident that probably within a year, we would be able to
          have the whole virus, including all the bits on the inside,” she said.
        </p>

        <h2>Drugs and Vaccines</h2>
        <p>
          Already, however, the new pictures of SARS-CoV-2 have become essential
          for the fight against the pandemic. Vaccine developers study the
          virus’s structure to ensure that the antibodies made by vaccines
          <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2622-0">
            grip tightly to the virus
          </a>
          . Drug developers are concocting molecules that disrupt the virus by

          The virus’s genome may offer other targets. Drugs may be able to lock
          onto loops and tangles to prevent the virus from controlling our
          ribosomes. “It’s very important that you know what the shape is, so
          you can develop the right chemistry to bind to that shape,” Dr.
          Rouskin said.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Gladfelter, meanwhile, wants to see if the physics of viral
          droplets may offer a new line of attack against SARS-CoV-2.
        </p>
        <p>
          “You could get a compound that would make them stickier, make them
          more jelly,” she said. “There are probably a lot of Achilles’ heels.”
        </p>

        <h2>Future Research</h2>
        <p>
          While the past few months have delivered a flood of data about the
          virus, some studies have made it clear that it will take years to make
          sense of SARS-CoV-2.
        </p>
        <p>
          Noam Stern-Ginossar and her colleagues at the Weizmann Institute in
          Israel, for example, have
          <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2739-1">
            found evidence
          </a>
          that the virus makes proteins that scientists have yet to find.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Stern-Ginossar and her colleagues surveyed the RNA of the virus in
          infected cells, tallying up all the ribosomes that were reading it.
          Some ribosomes clustered along known genes. But others were reading
          genes that had never been found before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ribosomes sometimes read just a section of the spike protein gene, for
          example. Presumably they make a mini-spike, which may very well carry
          out some essential job for the virus. A drug that disables it might
          cure Covid-19.
        </p>
        <p>
          But scientists can’t even begin to guess at these possibilities,
          because no one has yet spotted the mini-spike in the wild. And the
          same will be true for the other new genes, Dr. Stern-Ginossar’s team
          has found.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Each one will require additional work to figure out what they’re
          doing,” she said. “Biology takes time.”
