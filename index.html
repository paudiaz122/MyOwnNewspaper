        <p>
          Companies are planning to increase their spending on artificial
          intelligence and machine learning as a result of the pandemic, and IT
          leaders believe that those initiatives should have been a higher
          priority for their organizations all along, according to a newly
          released survey by Algorithmia, a provider of ML operations and
          management platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Algorithmia's "2020 Enterprise AI/ML Trends" survey was completed in
          August by over 100 IT directors and above who are involved with those
          initiatives and work in companies with at least $1 billion in annual
          sales and 5,000 or more employees, the company said.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is little doubt the events of the past six-plus months have
          disrupted the plans of IT organizations. In fact, 42% of IT leaders
          responding to Algorithmia's survey said that at least half of all
          their AI/ML projects were impacted from a priority, staffing, or
          funding standpoint because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
        </p>

        <p>
          But that doesn't mean those projects are going awayâ€”instead, their
          focus may have shifted, Algorithmia said. For example, 54% of IT
          leaders said their projects were focused on financial analysis and
          consumer insight prior to the pandemic. Coming out of the pandemic,
          the same IT leaders said these projects will be focused on cost
          optimization (59%) and customer experience (58%), according to the
          survey.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data suggests that while IT might lock-in on cost-cutting when
          times are tough, over the long term, officials will prioritize the
          adoption of new technologies that enhance and enable automation, the
          company said.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regardless of focus, IT leaders surveyed by Algorithmia said they
          agree that AI/ML projects will be a priority. Some 65% of survey
          respondents said that such projects were at or near the top of their
          priority list before the pandemic, and 33% said these applications are
          now higher on their list since the onset of the pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, 43% of IT leader respondents said that AI/ML matters much
          more than they thought as a result of the pandemic, and 23% said they
          realize now that the tech should have been their highest priority IT
          initiatives all along.
        </p>
        <p>
          The survey data also showed that IT leaders are planning to spend more
          on AI/ML, and the pandemic is increasing demand for people with
          related job skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, 91% of respondents said they were spending at least
          $1,000,000 annually on AI/ML before the pandemic, and 50% said they
          are planning to spend more than that, the survey found.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, a lack of in-house staff with AI/ML skills was the primary
          challenge for IT leaders before the pandemic, according to 59% of
          respondents. The most important job skills coming out of the pandemic
          are going to be security (69%), data management (64%), and systems
          integration (62%).
        </p>
        <p>
          "When we come through the pandemic, the companies that will emerge the
          strongest will be those that invested in tools, people, and processes
          that enable them to scale delivery of AI and ML-based applications to
          production," said Diego Oppenheimer, CEO of Algorithmia, in a
          statement. "We believe investments in AI/ML operations now will pay
          off for companies sooner than later. Despite the fact that we're still
          dealing with the pandemic, CIOs should be encouraged by the results of
          our survey."
